# What's this all about?
It's basically MYTV Broadcasting / myFreeview but through IPTV. All channels are sourced from official sources. For these who didn't want to buy MYTV Set-top-boxes and antennas starting from RM60, but have a TV box.

# Special thanks
Special thanks to @V-T-E-R for managing the IPTV links for Dailymotion sources (TV3 / DidikTV KPM / 8TV / TV9).
